hi, I'am joseph. I'am a Data Scientist and teacher.
When I was a teacher I always encouraged my student about learning a programming language. 
I realized that my real passion is IT and machine learning.
I am already teaching to humans somethings in technically and I started to study about data analyze and machine learning.
I joined a bootcamp to make accerelate to learn machine learning. 
And I â€˜moved on my skills to advanced advanced level. 
During the bootcamp I made a lot of friends like me that like IT.
we started to study the lessons about statistics and python modules about machine learning.
This social environment improved us more efficiently.
We learnt numpy, pandas, tensor flow, scipy, keras, sql, tableau, 
During the bootcamp we completed a lot of projects. you can check my project from my github account.
I always want to learn something about machine learning and improve my skills. and I am good at being a team member. 
During the bootcamp i leaded my friends and contribute their python learning. my principle is first learn and then teach. 
Of course learning from others at the same time.
I want to join your family so i will able to work and can learn new things for a certain purpose.
